# Overview

Welcome to `local-model-cookbook`, really stoked to have you find your way here!

Local models and edge AI refer to machine learning models that run directly on end-user devices (laptops, phones, etc) rather than in the cloud, thereby enabling privacy-preserving and offline AI experiences. This site is intended to serve as a simple reference that application developers can use to get started with integrating local models into their apps, providing practical recipes, implementation patterns and considerations for building with on-device AI.

# Contributing Guide

If you discover a great way to integrate local models into applications on a specific platform using particular model formats, runtimes, or frameworks, we'd love for you to share your knowledge! The goal is to help make edge AI more accessible to the broader developer community.

Some examples of valuable contributions:
- Step-by-step guides (i.e. recipes) for using specific model formats (GGUF, ONNX, etc) in desktop/mobile apps
- Implementation patterns and best practices for different runtimes (ONNX Runtime, TensorFlow Lite, etc)
- Tips and considerations for running models on resource-constrained devices

To contribute:
1. First create an issue describing what you plan to contribute. Discussions take place on GitHub Issues.
2. Fork this repository
3. Add your recipe/guide as a new markdown file under the appropriate section
4. Follow the existing documentation format and style
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of what your contribution adds

We especially welcome contributions that break down complex edge AI concepts and implementations into clear, practical steps that developers of all experience levels can follow.
